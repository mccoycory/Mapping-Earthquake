# Mapping Earthquake

# Overivew 

For this challenge, we were tasked with using Mapbox and Java Script to create an interactive dashboard. With this dashboard we will be using a Json file link from the earthquake database. The great thing about this link is that it is not static, meaning it when the link gets updated, our personal dashboard will get up as well. Using the D3 selector from Java Script, we were able to select specific data from the JSON file.

# Dropdown/ Selector 

From the layers, we created a selector box where we were able to quickly add and remove layers from the base map. This additional functionality allows the user to drill down and reserach specific data. Below is a screenshot of the dropdown options from the dashboard.
